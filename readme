For run: ./lattice-modularity-test testfile
In test file you must write action of automata, something like this:
4
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 1 1 4 4 6 6
2 2 2 5 5 7 7
3 3 3 5 5 6 6
2 2 2 4 4 6 6
Here '4' in first row - count of letters of alphabet, '7' in second row - count of 
states of automaton, third row - names of states, and next 4 rows - how the 
automaton is work.

Also you can set third parameter 'd' for debug ouput (you will see full lattice in
text form and connections between elements of lattice): ./lattice-modularity-test testfile d

The output of the program is pdf file with image of the lattice, and dot file, 
which it uses for generate pdf file (you can also out image of automaton, just
decomment section in main file function automaton_print()).

Program not stable. If count of elements of lattice was something >500, program will
be fail.

For compile run 'make'.
